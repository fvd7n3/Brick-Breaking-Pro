# Brick-Breaking-Pro


In this classic game, we need to launch a ball to break all the bricks set above and catch it. 

The rules of the game is very simple, all players have to do is to tilt the device to slide the bar below the breaks to launch and catch the ball. 

This game is controlled by the G-sensor, so players are not required to press the bar.

This game has cute and simple background and setting, and it suits people of all ages.

Let's try it together now!
